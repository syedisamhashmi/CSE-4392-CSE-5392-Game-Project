**Game Plot**

In a distant planet called Fruito or (vegus), there exist two prominent species, bananas, and potatoes, fighting for the same pool of limited resources.
While team bananas are content with what they have, potatoes wanted more. Over several centuries team potatoes were able to conquer and enslave all other fruit and veg species except bananas (like Romans and Gauls) and this angered them.
Team potatoes have thug veggies and fruits like onions, chilies. etc. at their disposal.

***Sub-bosses***

Onions wear gas masks and create acidic clouds that can stun bananas.
Chilies can throw fire. etc.
Potatoes can throw onion or chili bombs and can also be themed after this trait for boss fights.
Eg: Green color acidic potato, fire powered fiery hot potato)

A few warrior bananas have taken up the responsibility to save team bananas and that means fighting potatoes to death.
