# Astronaut Game

- Play as an astronaut who has been disconnected from their spaceship
- Free float in deep space, utilize the physics of zero gravity space to move your character
  - Use propelling objects such as fire extinguishers, water guns, leaf blowers etc. to propel yourself back to your spaceship
    - objects mostly just rotate, so hopefully there wouldn't need to be a lot of animation
- Controlled like a top-down twin stick shooter
  - 2D
  - Encourages satisfying, physics-based gameplay
- Dodge asteroids, space debris and possibly enemy aliens
- Maybe have a Half-Life gravity gun-like tool to pull useful objects towards you and fire objects away
  - Possibly creates interesting balance of using objects to propel yourself to your goal or use them to keep dangerous enemies away
- Space backgrounds are probably pretty easy to make
  - mostly stars and color gradients
- Probably have some cool spacey tunes
